# Chapter 11: Finding Answers: Watson Discovery

[Return to Table of Contents](../README.md)

This chapter is an update to the original chapter, where we used Retrieve and Rank to create a collection, 
process queries against that collection as both a straight retrieve and then later including 
the ranking capability as part of that service. 

Retrieve and Rank has been replaced with Watson Discovery. This means that we have better exploration tools available 
to us and, as well, can do things like create the necessary configuration file interactively
in the browser rather than only on our laptops. We can still do what we did in the past, we 
just have more options, now.
